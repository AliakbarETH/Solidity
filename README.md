# Solidity

This is the file which shows the first smart contract in solidity.

I have used remix.ethereum.org as my IDE

Then I installed necessary plugins including run and deploy solidity and solidity plugin.

Then I wrote this code and it asked for network. I choosed web3.js and then it asked for my meta mask configuration.

I used fake ethers from gorelli network and then connected my metamask and it worked.

If you want to run this project, you can follow the same steps and it will work out.
